<h2>EXPERT TIPS</h2>

<p>Use an ice-cream scoop to make perfectly shaped cookies. Level off the dough on the edge of the bowl for perfectly round cookies.</p>

<p>If you didn't think these cookies could get any better, think again! Get creative use with 1/2 cup each of semisweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips or butterscotch chips instead of the 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips. OMG these are good!</p>
